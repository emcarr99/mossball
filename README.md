# Accessibility Code Refactor - Challenge One

## Description
This challenge simulated a common on-the-job ticket. Improving the existing website accessibility features by the implentation of semantic HTML tags, addition of alt descriptors to images, and ensurance of logical code flow regardless of styling or positioning. Improvments to the CSS was done by condensing selectors and combining elements that share the same styling to avoid repetitions. This prevents potentional rendering problems.
